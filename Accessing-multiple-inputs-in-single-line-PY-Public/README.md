# Accessing-multiple-inputs-in-single-line-PY
Sometimes - we have to accept multiple inputs in a single line.
The way to accept multiple integers in a single line is to use the split and map function.

* **split:** function breaks the input based on the separator - by default, it splits inputs separated by spaces in a single line into different inputs which you can assign to different variables
* **map:** function converts each input into the defined datatype

# Syntax
> a, b, c = map(int, input().split())   # assigns integer input values to variable\
> s a, b and c
